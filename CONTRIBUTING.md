## 📝 Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with these modifications:

- **Line length**: 100 characters (instead of 79)
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces
- **Quotes**: Double quotes `"` for strings
- **Naming**:
  - Variables: `snake_case`
  - Constants: `UPPER_CASE`
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Functions: `snake_case`

### Code Formatting

Use **Black** for automatic formatting:

# Format all files

black backend/ frontend/

# Check formatting without changes

black --check backend/ frontend/

# Format specific file

black backend/dqn_routing.py

### Linting

Use **Flake8** for style checking:

# Check all files

flake8 backend/ frontend/ --max-line-length=100

# Check specific file

flake8 backend/dqn_routing.py

Ignore these errors (add to `.flake8`):

```ini
[flake8]
max-line-length = 100
ignore = E203, W503
exclude = .venv, __pycache__
```

### Type Hints

Add type hints to all function signatures:

**Good:**

```python
def find_path(self, source: int, destination: int) -> Tuple[List[int], float, float]:
    """Find shortest path using trained agent."""
    pass
```

**Bad:**

```python
def find_path(self, source, destination):
    """Find shortest path."""
    pass
```

### Documentation Strings

Use **Google-style docstrings**:

```python
def train(self, source: int, destination: int, num_episodes: int = None) -> None:
    """
    Train the Q-Learning agent on specified route.

    Trains the agent to find optimal path from source to destination
    using Q-learning algorithm with epsilon-greedy exploration.

    Args:
        source: Source node ID (0 to num_nodes-1)
        destination: Destination node ID (0 to num_nodes-1)
        num_episodes: Number of training episodes (default: from config)

    Returns:
        None. Updates internal Q-table.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If source or destination not in network
        RuntimeError: If training fails to converge

    Example:
        >>> agent = QLearningRouting(network)
        >>> agent.train(source=0, destination=9, num_episodes=1000)
        >>> path, cost, time = agent.find_path(0, 9)
    """
    pass
```

### Code Comments

- **Explain WHY, not WHAT**
- Comment complex algorithms
- Add TODO comments for future work

**Good:**

```python
# Use Double DQN to reduce Q-value overestimation
# Standard DQN overestimates due to max operation
policy_q = self.policy_net(state)
target_q = self.target_net(state)
```

**Bad:**

```python
# Get Q values
policy_q = self.policy_net(state)
target_q = self.target_net(state)
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=backend --cov=frontend

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_q_learning.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_q_learning.py::test_training

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run and show print statements
pytest -s
```

### Writing Tests

Place tests in `tests/` directory with `test_` prefix:

```python
import pytest
from backend.q_learning_routing import QLearningRouting
from backend.graph_manager import NetworkGraph
from backend.config import Config

def test_q_learning_initialization():
    """Test Q-Learning agent initializes correctly."""
    network = NetworkGraph.create_mesh(num_nodes=5)
    config = Config()
    agent = QLearningRouting(network, config)

    assert agent.qtable is not None
    assert agent.epsilon == config.QL_EPSILON
    assert agent.total_training_episodes == 0

def test_q_learning_training():
    """Test Q-Learning training updates Q-table."""
    network = NetworkGraph.create_mesh(num_nodes=5)
    agent = QLearningRouting(network)

    # Train
    agent.train(source=0, destination=4, num_episodes=100)

    # Verify
    assert agent.total_training_episodes == 100
    assert len(agent.qtable) > 0

def test_q_learning_find_path():
    """Test Q-Learning finds valid path."""
    network = NetworkGraph.create_mesh(num_nodes=5)
    agent = QLearningRouting(network)
    agent.train(source=0, destination=4, num_episodes=500)

    path, cost, time = agent.find_path(0, 4)

    assert len(path) > 0
    assert path[0] == 0
    assert path[-1] == 4
    assert cost > 0
    assert time >= 0

@pytest.fixture
def sample_network():
    """Fixture providing sample network for tests."""
    return NetworkGraph.create_mesh(num_nodes=10)

def test_with_fixture(sample_network):
    """Test using fixture."""
    agent = QLearningRouting(sample_network)
    assert agent.network.num_nodes == 10
```

### Test Coverage

Aim for **80%+ test coverage**:

```bash
# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=backend --cov=frontend --cov-report=html

# Open report
# Windows:
start htmlcov/index.html
# Linux/Mac:
open htmlcov/index.html
```

```

### Code Documentation

**For functions/methods:**

```python
def calculate_reward(
    self,
    current_node: int,
    action: int,
    destination: int,
    visited: Set[int],
    path_length: int
) -> float:
    """

        Reward value (typically -10 to +100)

    Example:
        >>> reward = designer.calculate_reward(0, 1, 9, {0}, 1)
        >>> print(reward)  # e.g., 3.5
    """
    pass
```

**For classes:**

```python

    """
    pass
```

## 🎨 UI Contributions

### Streamlit Guidelines

When contributing to the UI:

1. **Maintain consistent styling**

   ```python
   st.markdown("### Section Title")  # Use ### for sections
   st.info("ℹ️ Info message")       # Use emojis
   st.success("✅ Success")
   st.warning("⚠️ Warning")
   st.error("❌ Error")
   ```

2. **Add helpful descriptions**

   ```python
   st.slider(
       "Number of Episodes",
       min_value=100,
       max_value=5000,
       value=1000,
       step=100,
       help="More episodes = better convergence but slower training"
   )
   ```

3. **Use progress indicators**
   ```python
   progress_bar = st.progress(0)
   for i in range(episodes):
       # Training logic
       progress_bar.progress((i + 1) / episodes)
   ```
